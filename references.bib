  abstract  = "In an environment in which growth and employment prospects in
               many countries remain subdued and a number of high-profile
               corruption cases have fueled moral outrage, and amid a growing
               consensus that corruption can seriously undermine a country's
               ability to deliver inclusive economic growth in a number of
               different areas, addressing corruption globally---in both
               developed and developing countries---has become increasingly
               urgent. When corruption impairs government functions, it can
               adversely affect a number of important determinants of economic
               performance, including macrofinancial stability, investment,
               human capital accumulation, and total factor productivity.
               Moreover, when systemic corruption affects virtually all state
               functions, distrust of government can become so pervasive that
               it can lead to violence, civil strife, and conflict, with
               devastating social and economic implications. This Staff
               Discussion Note focuses on corruption that arises from the abuse
               of public office for private gain, whether it manifests itself
               transactionally (for example, a bribe) or through powerful
               networks between business and government that effectively result
               in the privatization of public policy. While designing and
               implementing an anticorruption strategy requires change on many
               different levels, the IMF's experience in assisting member
               countries suggests that several elements need to be given
               priority: transparency, rule of law, and economic reform
               policies designed to eliminate excessive regulation. Perhaps
               most important, however, addressing corruption requires building
               effective institutions, with the clear objective of developing a
               competent civil service that takes pride in being independent of
               both private influence and public interference.",

This work illustrates the main characteristics of the blockchain and its functioning, and then focuses on the potential applications that can be implemented for developing countries. More specifically, the work, considers the case of financial inclusion in Africa, on the basis of the Global Findex 2017 data, the World Bank Survey on financial inclusion. The empirical analysis identifies the weaknesses in the current financial system in Africa and constitues the basis to discuss potential blockchain solutions to reduce the current level of financial exclusion and pursue sustainable development for African countries. }

The results of various cross-sectional regressions provide substantial evidence that corruption significantly aggravates the problems with bad loans in the banking sector. In this study, we also find some evidence of a new channel through which corruption lowers economic growth: Corruption distorts the allocation of bank funds from normal projects to bad projects, which decreases the quality of private investments, hence it decreases economic growth.}

However, this astronomical growth of banking and Islamic finance was associated with a high level of corruption that plagues many Muslim countries. This ailment of corruption can deter Islamic banking to be a better effective and meaningful pathway for poverty reduction and economic development. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of corruption on the soundness of Islamic banks (IBs). Using a panel of 69 IBs over the period 2008–2010, we provide robust evidence that the corruption level aggravates the problem of impaired financing.}

                 paper, we report initial results of two rounds of a large

Blockchain innovations can help build trust and transparency in international climate finance and could potentially have major implications in scaling and speeding up north-south, south-south, and peer-to-peer climate finance transfers. This chapter will explore the potential of Blockchain to provide scalable solutions in the areas of: tracking climate finance, results tracking, climate adaptation, financial inclusion, and identity. It will discuss requirements to achieve scale, including building the ecosystem by linking Blockchain developers, and funding sources with people working on problems of poverty.

The analysis first reveals that a lower level of corruption had a positive impact on bank stability and is associated with fewer credit losses and with more moderate credit growth. It then highlights the importance of bank and country characteristics in identifying the asymmetric effects of corruption on bank stability. Our evidence suggests that stability of banks that are acting in a country that has not adopted a corporate governance code or is not a member of the European Union is affected more by the corruption. Also, in countries with higher levels of corruption banks could increase their stability if they implement rigorous corporate governance practices. }
